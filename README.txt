To run the application, follow the instructions in the README file. This application uses Flask to create API endpoints for fetching data, processing data, and retrieving processed data. The data_processor module contains a simple data processing function that converts all text to upper case. The processed data is stored in an in-memory dictionary.

To run the application, follow the instructions in the README file. Once running, you can use a tool like curl or a web browser to access the API endpoints. 


For instance:

curl http://localhost:5000/fetch_data to fetch mock data
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"data": [...]} http://localhost:5000/process_data to process the data
curl http://localhost:5000/get_processed_data to retrieve the processed data
